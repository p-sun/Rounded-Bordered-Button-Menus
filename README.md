# Rounded-Bordered-Button-Menus
A custom button and two scrollable menus using the custom button. The button changes color upon touch. The UIStackView and UICollectionView menus made from these buttons. Swift 4.

The collectionView is on the left, the bordered button is in the middle, and the stack view is on the right.

The buttons keeps the selection state. i.e. Tap once to make it cyan, tap again to turn it back to white.

The button takes a custom color and font. Both menus allows you to set the text for each item. Feel free to expose anything else you need to the end user. It's pretty easy to modify. Let me know if you have any questions!
